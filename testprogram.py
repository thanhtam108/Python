# Define a list of student names.

# Create an empty dictionary to store the grades of each student. The keys of the dictionary should be the student names, and the values should be lists of their grades.

# Implement a function that allows the user to input grades for each student. The function should:

# Ask the user to input the grades for each student one by one.
# Use a loop to input multiple grades for each student until the user decides to stop.
# Store the grades in the dictionary under the respective student's name.
# Implement a function that calculates and prints the average grade for each student.

# Implement a function that calculates and prints the overall class average.

# Implement error handling to ensure that the user inputs valid grades (between 0 and 100) and that the user doesn't input grades for non-existent students.
